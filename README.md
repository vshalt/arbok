# Arbok

Welcome to the Arbok! This repository provides a practical implementation of an interpreter inspired by Thorsten Ball's book, **"Writing an Interpreter in Go"**. The project aims to walk through the process of building an interpreter from scratch, focusing on understanding the core concepts of interpretation and language design.

## Parts of the interpreter
- Token: Tokenizes the input
- Lexer: Lexically analyzes the tokens
- Parser: Parses the lexer tokens
- Evaluator: Evaluates the parsed tokens



## Getting Started

To get started with the Interpreter Project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vshalt/arbok.git
```

### 2. Run the language interpreter
